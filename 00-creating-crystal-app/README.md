# 00 - Creating a Crystal app
## _The beginning of everything_

Here you will learn how to initialize a Crystal app!

After you complete the [installation](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) you'll be able to create and run your first Crystal program! 

 1. Now, create a folder where you can study Crystal using: `mkdir learning-crystal`, then change the directory with: `cd learning-crystal`
 2. After this, you can type this command `crystal --version` to check if Crystal is really installed.
 3. So, finally, you can type `crystal init app example`. But you may have some questions, like "What this command do after all?". basically, it will initialize (`init`) an `app` inside the folder `example`. It will create some subfolders. 'spec' will containing your tests, 'src' will containing your source code.
